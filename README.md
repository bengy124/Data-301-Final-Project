# Group 1030 - Epic gamer data 
---
## Milestones

[Milestone 1](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301/project/milestone01.html).

## Topic Description

  With this dataset we can hopefully create some interesting observations about various Steam Games and how well they perform relative to the given variables such as release date, genre, etc. Our group has some interest in this data as we have all played video games before as a pastime, so it is both fun and familiar. There are a lot of questions that can be asked and analyzed by using this data and i think it will provide some insight as to what makes a game popular. 

  Examples of these questions could be things like: 
  What has a greater impact on a game's popularity, the ability to play multiplayer, or amount of DLC available? 
  Does price have a substantial impact on a game's metacritic score?

  Building a dashboard using this data should be straightforward, as a lot of variables being analyzed are fairly easy to understand. Not needing to add as much descriptions to the numbers will make the dashboard look a lot cleaner and allow it to have a good flow.

## Data Description 

  The Steam data group 1030 has chosen is given by the Data.world user Craig Kelly, this data is gathered from public Steam API, which can be used to see information on purchases through Steam this dataset will only include video games purchases and ownership from 2016 and not market transactions. The Steam API is then compiled into a comma separated value file that gives us a list of available games. There are around thirteen thousand five hundred entries in this dataset each of which has an abundance of comparable variables and options for use in sorting and comparing. These variables go from player base to release date to operating system to price, there is also options for sorting through with steam tags or genres which can be seen on any game that can be purchased through or is available on Steam. With this dataset we have a good amount of comparable data with many variables and options to give a wide variety of conclusions that our group can make when analyzing the data. 
## Team

## Research Questions
1. What game genres are the most popular (they have the most owners)?
2. What game genres make the most money?
3. Does the amount of games in a genre correlate to the genres popularity?
4. How do game ratings compare across genres?
5. How do game ratings compare across genres?
