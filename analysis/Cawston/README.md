 ## EDA
     I believe going over the amount of owners for all the genres, recomendations, ratings, price, and maybe even year released could provide insight into what the best course of action for genre on steam would be.
     I have made some basic plots the need refinement with the multiple columns vs the owners.
     A function to turn the True and False into 1s and 0s would be usefull to make some bar plots to compare the genres
     I believe there are some games like dota that have a vast amount of players making the graph visuals harder to read maybe ommiting ftp games will make it easier to analyse the price per owner.
